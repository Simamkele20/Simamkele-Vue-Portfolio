    <h3>
      I`m Simamkele Tancu, a Full-Stack development student at Life Choices Academy.I initially wanted to focus on Front-end development, but now I enjoy full-stack because it allows me to work on all aspects of a project, from start to finish. My goal is to become a Professional full-stack developer, and I plan to achieve this by mastering both front-end and back-end development.
      In addition to my technical skills, I`m also a great communicator and team paler. I`m comfortable giving presentations and am always eager to learn new things.I`m confident in my ability to adapt to new challenges and am excited to start my career as a full-stack developer.
